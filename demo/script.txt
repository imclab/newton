"finished" unused parts:
- fd-planes
- mirror scene
- mercury scene

"finished" unused parts (need exporting):
- ground cracking up
- sfc scroller in corridor (see scroller2.avi on the webdav-thingie)
- blob running down some drain-thingy

unfinished scheduled parts:
- growing stuff (needs max-exporter and direction)
- parallax-scroller (some placeholder graphics still, need to be longer and more entertaining)

upcoming un-scheduled parts:
- slimy blob in front of camera (blob is modelled, need code)
- slime-breaker (needs code for prototype, and if it looks good enough - real graphics and a background-effect)

random finished but so far unused data that can be tossed in where needed:
- skateboard-overlays
- 3d-ish sfc logo
- gangstah pictures of guns and sneakers stolen from Mr.Internet ;)

absolutely missing stuff:
- LOGOS!
- A picture of kekkonen spanking Matt-Matt.
